    X 2. set backend authorization levels
    X 3. frontend demo login button in header
    4. if a request is made from tour level handle error gracefully
    5. disallow user of tour level to submit request (editor: [save, publish, revert, delete], paginator: [delete])
    X 6. hide the user update option for tour
    7. make the admin button more clear
Demo User
    -- Remove basic user level from the Administrative Tour user (no commenting or updating user details).
    -- Backend will process get requests from the level/deny post and put requests
    -- Login to this user via a button on the header.
    -- Has privledge to see admin page, can access create/edit pages.
        --Paginator: cannot delete posts, make a notification in the modal on click.
        --BlogPost: how to have it so that a 'created post' skips axios and displays as local?
    -- Does not make axios requests
    -- Cannot update, only create from new.
